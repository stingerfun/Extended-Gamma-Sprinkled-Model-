Here's a draft README file for a GitHub repository containing the analyzed data from the article:

# Crossover Interference Analysis Data

This repository contains data analyzed in the article "Statistical analysis and simulation allowing simultaneously positive, negative, and no crossover interference in multilocus recombination data" by Sapielkin et al.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### /populations

This folder contains data from real populations analyzed in the study:

- Norway spruce (Picea abies)
- Wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium) 
- Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris)
- Conifer larch (Larix principis)

Each subfolder contains genetic mapping data used for crossover interference analysis.

### /tables 

This folder contains data from simulation tables for different chromosome maps with step of size 5cM:

## Data Format

Population data is provided in standard Multipoint software genetic mapping file CSV format.

## Usage

These datasets can be used to reproduce the analyses in the paper or for further investigation of crossover interference patterns. Please cite the original article if using this data in your research.
